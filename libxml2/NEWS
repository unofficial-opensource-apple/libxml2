    workload.
   - The include are now located under $prefix/include/libxml (instead of
    $prefix/include/gnome-xml), they also are referenced by
    #include <libxml/xxx.h>
    instead of
    #include "xxx.h"
  
   - a new URI module for parsing URIs and following strictly RFC 2396
   - the memory allocation routines used by libxml can now be overloaded
    dynamically by using xmlMemSetup()
   - The previously CVS only tool tester has been renamed
    xmllint and is now installed as part of the libxml2
    package
   - The I/O interface has been revamped. There is now ways to plug in
    specific I/O modules, either at the URI scheme detection level using
    xmlRegisterInputCallbacks()  or by passing I/O functions when creating a
    parser context using xmlCreateIOParserCtxt()
   - there is a C preprocessor macro LIBXML_VERSION providing the version
    number of the libxml module in use
   - a number of optional features of libxml can now be excluded at
    configure time (FTP/HTTP/HTML/XPath/Debug)


2.0.0beta: Mar 14 2000:
   - This is a first Beta release of libxml version 2
   - It's available only fromxmlsoft.org
    FTP, it's packaged as libxml2-2.0.0beta and available as tar and
  RPMs
   - This version is now the head in the Gnome CVS base, the old one is
    available under the tag LIB_XML_1_X
   - This includes a very large set of changes. From a  programmatic point
    of view applications should not have to be modified too much, check the
    upgrade page

   - Some interfaces may changes (especially a bit about encoding).
   - the updates includes:
    fix I18N support. ISO-Latin-x/UTF-8/UTF-16 (nearly) seems correctly
        handled now
      Better handling of entities, especially well-formedness checking
        and proper PEref extensions in external subsets
      DTD conditional sections
      Validation now correctly handle entities content
      change
        structures to accommodate DOM

   - change

   - Serious progress were made toward compliance, here are the result of the test against the
    OASIS testsuite (except the Japanese tests since I don't support that
    encoding yet). This URL is rebuilt every couple of hours using the CVS
    head version.


1.8.7: Mar 6 2000:
   - This is a bug fix release:
   - It is possible to disable the ignorable blanks heuristic used by
    libxml-1.x, a new function  xmlKeepBlanksDefault(0) will allow this. Note
    that for adherence to XML spec, this behaviour will be disabled by
    default in 2.x . The same function will allow to keep compatibility for
    old code.
   - Blanks in <a>  </a> constructs are not ignored anymore,
    avoiding heuristic is really the Right Way :-\
   - The unchecked use of snprintf which was breaking libxml-1.8.6
    compilation on some platforms has been fixed
   - nanoftp.c nanohttp.c: Fixed '#' and '?' stripping when processing
  URIs


1.8.6: Jan 31 2000:
   - added a nanoFTP transport module, debugged until the new version of rpmfind can use
    it without troubles


1.8.5: Jan 21 2000:
   - adding APIs to parse a well balanced chunk of XML (production [43] content of the
    XML spec)
   - fixed a hideous bug in xmlGetProp pointed by Rune.Djurhuus@fast.no
   - Jody Goldberg <jgoldberg@home.com> provided another patch trying
    to solve the zlib checks problems
   - The current state in gnome CVS base is expected to ship as 1.8.5 with
    gnumeric soon


1.8.4: Jan 13 2000:
   - bug fixes, reintroduced xmlNewGlobalNs(), fixed xmlNewNs()
   - all exit() call should have been removed from libxml
   - fixed a problem with INCLUDE_WINSOCK on WIN32 platform
   - added newDocFragment()


1.8.3: Jan 5 2000:
   - a Push interface for the XML and HTML parsers
   - a shell-like interface to the document tree (try tester --shell :-)
   - lots of bug fixes and improvement added over XMas holidays
   - fixed the DTD parsing code to work with the xhtml DTD
   - added xmlRemoveProp(), xmlRemoveID() and xmlRemoveRef()
   - Fixed bugs in xmlNewNs()
   - External entity loading code has been revamped, now it uses
    xmlLoadExternalEntity(), some fix on entities processing were added
   - cleaned up WIN32 includes of socket stuff


1.8.2: Dec 21 1999:
   - I got another problem with includes and C++, I hope this issue is fixed
    for good this time
   - Added a few tree modification functions: xmlReplaceNode,
    xmlAddPrevSibling, xmlAddNextSibling, xmlNodeSetName and
    xmlDocSetRootElement
   - Tried to improve the HTML output with help from Chris Lahey



1.8.1: Dec 18 1999:
   - various patches to avoid troubles when using libxml with C++ compilers
    the "namespace" keyword and C escaping in include files
   - a problem in one of the core macros IS_CHAR was corrected
   - fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.0 breaking default namespace processing,
    and more specifically the Dia application
   - fixed a posteriori validation (validation after parsing, or by using a
    Dtd not specified in the original document)
   - fixed a bug in


1.8.0: Dec 12 1999:
   - cleanup, especially memory wise
   - the parser should be more reliable, especially the HTML one, it should
    not crash, whatever the input !
   - Integrated various patches, especially a speedup improvement for large
    dataset from Carl Nygard,
    configure with --with-buffers to enable them.
   - attribute normalization, oops should have been added long ago !
   - attributes defaulted from DTDs should be available, xmlSetProp() now
    does entities escaping by default.


1.7.4: Oct 25 1999:
   - Lots of HTML improvement
   - Fixed some errors when saving both XML and HTML
   - More examples, the regression tests should now look clean
   - Fixed a bug with contiguous charref


1.7.3: Sep 29 1999:
   - portability problems fixed
   - snprintf was used unconditionally, leading to link problems on system
    were it's not available, fixed


1.7.1: Sep 24 1999:
   - The basic type for strings manipulated by libxml has been renamed in
    1.7.1 from CHAR to xmlChar. The reason
    is that CHAR was conflicting with a predefined type on Windows. However
    on non WIN32 environment, compatibility is provided by the way of  a
    #define .
   - Changed another error : the use of a structure field called errno, and
    leading to troubles on platforms where it's a macro


1.7.0: Sep 23 1999:
   - Added the ability to fetch remote DTD or parsed entities, see the nanohttp module.
   - Added an errno to report errors by another mean than a simple printf
    like callback
   - Finished ID/IDREF support and checking when validation
   - Serious memory leaks fixed (there is now a memory wrapper module)
   - Improvement of XPath
    implementation
   - Added an HTML parser front-end
